	<h2>About Me</h2>
	
	<p>I am currently a fourth year undergraduate student at the University of Iowa double majoring in
	International Studies with a focus on East Asia and Business with a focus on Information Systems. On 
	campus I am this year's president of the Vietnamese Student Association, which I have been a part of for the 
	past three years, and the secretary of the Filipino American Student Association, which I have been 
	a part of for two years, along with being affiliated with many other multicultural organizations. 
	My aspirations include working for an international NGO or a company's corporate social responsibility 
	department and attaining a Master's in Public Policy. In my free time I like to catch up on television, 
	dance, go running, play tennis, and draw.</p>
	
	<p>
	I am a Taidam-Chinese American, born and raised in Des Moines, Iowa, with two older brothers. My parents 
	immigrated to America from Laos in 1975 as refugees of the Vietnam War, a story which I never forget and 
	hope to honor for my whole life. Their sacrifices and struggles have influenced me to contribute to the 
	positive change that I want to see in the world. My ethnic heritage is extremely important to me, which 
	has compelled me to focus my senior project for my International Studies major on my culture's beliefs 
	and rituals surrounding death in an attempt to archive the information for future generations. I want to 
	perpetually give back to the communities that have shaped me, and to those that are in need as much as 
	possible.
