	<h2>About Me</h2>
	
	<p>I am currently in my fifth year of undergraduate studies at the University of Iowa, double majoring in
	International Studies with a focus on East Asia and Business with a focus on Information Systems. 
	My aspirations include working with an international team on software solutions,
	for an international NGO/non-profits, or a company's corporate social responsibility department.
	I also have the hope of attaining a Master's degree in Public Policy in order to affect positive changes in our systems.
	It may seem that my career intents are wide and varied, but I believe that tech solutions to business problems has
	the ability to go hand-in-hand with social consciousness.</p>
	
	<h3> Family Background </h3>
	<p>
	I am a Taidam-Chinese American, born and raised in Des Moines, Iowa, with two older brothers. My parents 
	immigrated to America from Laos in 1975 as refugees of the Vietnam War, a story which I never forget and 
	hope to honor for my whole life. Their sacrifices and struggles have influenced me to contribute to the 
	positive change that I want to see in the world. My ethnic heritage is extremely important to me, which 
	has compelled me to focus my senior project for my International Studies major on my culture's beliefs 
	and rituals surrounding death in an attempt to archive the information for future generations. I want to 
	perpetually give back to the communities that have shaped me, and to those that are in need as much as 
	possible.
	</p>
	
	<h3> Hobbies and Interests </h3>
		<ul>
			<li> Fashion Design 
			<br> I took fashion design and merchandising classes for two years in high school, honing my sewing skills and expressing
			my creativity, and I absolutely loved it. The creative outlet really boosted my self-confidence and allowed me to explore 
			things outside of and ultimately expand my comfort zone. One of my dream jobs would be to work costume design for TV or film.

			<li> Tennis
			<br> I played tennis in all 4 years of my high school career, but my interest in the sport started way before then.
			My older brothers taught me how to play when I was young, and it is one of our connections that drive our brotherhood to this day.
			Some of my favorite tennis players include the Williams sisters, Kei Nishikori, Novak Djokovic, Maria Sharapova, and James Blake. </li>
			<li> Social Justice 
			<br> I owe a great deal of my social consciousness to Monsoon United Asian Women of Iowa, a non-profit organization 
			that allowed me to intern for them for one and a half years in high school. They offered many opportunities for me 
			to learn about equity, feminism, racism, and so many things in between. I was even given the chance to speak on behalf 
			of the organization's youth program in a national summit for Asian American education advocates. I still continue 
			to educate myself on the issues prevalent in my own communities and across the world.</li>
			<li> Dance 
			<br> Dance performances have always been able to evoke deep emotions in my heart for reasons unknown. When I took 
			a course in Thai and Southeast Dance with Waewdao Sirisook in 2015, I finally began to understand dance as another
			art form that is able to present history, culture, identity in a way that is sophisticated, complex, and graceful.
